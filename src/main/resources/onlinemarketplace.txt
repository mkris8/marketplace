You have an online marketplace, 

here is a sample of some of the products available on your site:


Product code | Name                   | Price
001          | Travel Card Holder     | £9.25
002          | Personalised cufflinks | £45.00
003          | Kids T-shirt           | £19.95

The marketing team want to offer promotions as an incentive for your customers to purchase these items:

If you spend over £60, then you get 10% off your purchase.
If you buy 2 or more travel card holders then the price drops to £8.50.


Your check-out can scan items in any order, and because your 
promotions will change, it needs to be flexible 
regarding your promotional rules.


The Java Interface for your checkout service is used like this (shown in Java):


Checkout co = new Checkout(promotionalRules);
co.scan(item);
co.scan(item);
Double price = co.total();


Implement a checkout system that fulfils these requirements.
